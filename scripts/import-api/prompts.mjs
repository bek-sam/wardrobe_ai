Input image: The reference photograph shows the exact garment, either by itself or worn by a person. Use it only to identify and reconstruct the garment.

Primary request: Reconstruct ONLY the complete empty ${name} (${category}) as a clean, front-facing ecommerce catalog product photograph. If a wearer is present, remove them. Remove every other garment, object, and background element. Show the complete item naturally arranged and symmetrical, with no person, body, mannequin, or hanger visible.

Garment fidelity: Preserve the reference garment's exact primary color ${primary}${secondary}, material and texture, silhouette, neckline, sleeves, fastenings, pattern, and distinctive details (${details}). Preserve any clearly legible existing graphic or logo exactly, but do not invent or reinterpret uncertain logos, text, pockets, seams, hardware, colors, or decoration.

Composition: Centered straight-on product view. Keep the entire garment inside the frame with generous, even padding on every side. No cropping or truncation.

Background: Perfectly flat, absolutely uniform solid ${chromaKey} chroma-key color, edge-to-edge. No shadows, gradient, texture, vignette, floor, horizon, reflection, or lighting variation.

Lighting: Neutral diffuse product lighting contained on the garment only.

Avoid: person, body, skin, hair, mannequin, hanger, props, other garments, retail tags, cast shadow, contact shadow, reflection, watermark, caption, border, background variation, or chroma spill.

Critical: Use no ${chromaKey} anywhere in the garment. Produce exactly one complete garment with a crisp, separable outer silhouette.`;

Keep the complete featured item clearly visible and unobstructed, use understated neutral supporting clothes, realistic anatomy, natural light, authentic fabric, a tasteful real-world setting, and leave environmental space around the model.
